If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

Nonbiri is a self-hosted back-end and front-end for MangaDex. Just something I made for myself because MangaDex's new UI is bloated piece of hot garbage. The back-end itself is lightweight because of Go's garbage collector (< 100MB).

### Features

- Online/offline read and browse MangaDex
- History tracker and scheduled updates
- Chapters and covers are automatically downloaded/cached forever
- Real-time synchronization between tabs/browsers and computers
- Long strip, right-to-left and left-to-right reading modes
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts for navigating between pages and chapters


**Shipped version:** 0.1.8~ynh1

**Demo:** https://demo.example.com
