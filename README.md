## Overview

![Nonbiri](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rs1703/nonbiri/gh-pages/1.png)

_The UI is inspired by [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) (Please use that if you want to read manga on mobile devices)._

# Nonbiri

Nonbiri is a self-hosted back-end and front-end for MangaDex. Just something I made for myself because MangaDex's new UI is bloated piece of hot garbage. The back-end itself is lightweight because of Go's garbage collector (< 100MB).

![Memory usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rs1703/nonbiri/gh-pages/2.png)

## Features

- Online/offline read and browse MangaDex
- History tracker and scheduled updates
- Chapters and covers are automatically downloaded/cached forever
- Real-time synchronization between tabs/browsers and computers
- Long strip, right-to-left and left-to-right reading modes
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts for navigating between pages and chapters

Library and history are stored locally, Nonbiri will not push follows and reading history to MangaDex for obvious reasons.
